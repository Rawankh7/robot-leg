This project features a 3D design of robotic legs, incorporating a solid sphere for the knee joint. 

Design Rationale
Solid Sphere for Knee Joint:

Increased Mobility: The solid sphere allows for smooth, multi-directional movement, mimicking the natural movement of a human knee joint. This design facilitates more 
dynamic and versatile leg motions, which can be beneficial for tasks requiring complex maneuvers.

Simplified Mechanics: By using a single spherical element, the design reduces the need for multiple interacting components, leading to a more straightforward and potentially more robust mechanical system.
Improved Durability: The solid sphere provides a continuous, uniform surface that can distribute stress more evenly, potentially enhancing the overall durability and longevity
